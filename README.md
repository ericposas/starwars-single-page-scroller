# Kettle Web Development Challenge

ðŸ˜„ Thanks for having a look at our Web Development Challenge.

## Our Goal

Create a responsive web page from visual designs and written requirements.

We treat this as a real project and want you to help us discover how you like to work, so let's define scope, schedule & process tailored to you. Please ask questions and help us help you if anything is unclear.

We scaffolded the [HTML](./workspace/index.html) with content. You'll need you to add fonts, images, styles and for bonus points, interactivity!

Please:
1. Do all your work in a GIT branch.
2. Do all your work in the [workspace](./workspace) directory.
3. Set up build tooling if you feel it serves the project.
4. Ask questions with GitHub Issues and assign to [Ray Patterson](https://github.com/raypatterson).
